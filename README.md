# SCRUM TICKET TRACKER
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This is a unique ticket tracker notification system that is specifically catered to those that use the Agile(Scrum) framework for developing simple and complex projects. A simple three column desing displays what needs to be done, the daily goal, and how far along the project is as a whole. Users can switch the middle pannel between two views: Daily Scrums, and Issues. Daily Scrums, as its name suggests, displays a checklist curated by the Scrum Master, and provides daily goals, as well as progress posted by team members. The Issues window displays bugs, and issues that the team is facing which need to be solved. Issues can be marked with three different levels of urgency to notify others on the team of their importance.

WHAT IS SCRUM: Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum
employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency,
inspection, and adaptation.
