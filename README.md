# bugTracker
Project Description:
This is a unique ticket tracker notification system that is specifically catered to those that use the Agile(Scrum) framework for developing simple and complex projects. A simple three column desing is used to give a clear view of what needs to be done, the daily goal, and how far along the project is as a whole. 
A notification system that tracks defects in software as tickets, and allows for a development manager to observe the overall process of the project. Tracked items are listed as open, closed, or under development. 

WHAT IS SCRUM: Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum
employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency,
inspection, and adaptation.
